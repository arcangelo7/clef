CLEF is a lightweight Linked Open Data (LOD) native cataloguing system tailored to small-medium collaborative projects. It offers a web-ready solution for setting up data collection or crowdsourcing campaigns. It is designed to facilitate admin tasks, and to allow collaborators to produce high quality linked open data via user interface, without the burden of understanding what all this fuzz around LOD is about!

Some highlights:

 * customisable: create your templates for data collection
 * collaborative: allow everybody to contribute to your catalogue and grant permissions to smaller groups of collaborators
 * peer-review: allow collaborators to review records before publication
 * autocompletion: ensure collaborators reference the same contents. Autocomplete suggestions from Wikidata, geonames and your own catalogue make it easier!
 * synchronization with github: use github to authenticate collaborators, to backup and version your data
 * web archiving: save your web sources for future use in Internet archive
 * release 5-star data store, serve, and query your data as Linked Open Data
 * browse data immediately CLEF comes with an online browsable catalogue. You can create indexes with one click (no need to develop another application for showcasing your data!)
 * work locally or remote use CLEF from your desktop or on a remote server
